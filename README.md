# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-ML-models

The task of predicting Titanic passenger survival using the available data in the Titanic dataset involves applying machine learning models, including :

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)

These models leverage the features in the dataset to provide predictions on whether a passenger survived or perished during the Titanic disaster
